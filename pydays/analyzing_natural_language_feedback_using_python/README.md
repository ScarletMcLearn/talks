# Analyzing natural language feedback using Python

This is the source material I used for a talk at the PyDays 2018 conference. 
It is distributed under the permissive 
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, meaning you
can copy, redistribute, remix, transform and build upon the material for any
purpose, even commercially.

So feel free to use it as basis for your own analysis.

It includes the slides for [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and the
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook with the source code. There also is a
small lexicon to get started which covers the examples.

Installation instructions are included in the notebook, which you can 
[view in its rendered form](analyzing_natural_language_feedback_using_python.ipynb). 

The slides can also be 
[viewed online](https://www.slideshare.net/roskakori/analyzing-natural-language-feedback-using-python).

The data originally analyzed came from the [TeLLers](https://tellers.co.at/) feedback application.
